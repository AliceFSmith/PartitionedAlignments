# Nexus file
1. Line 1 is '#NEXUS' (and that only)
2. Line 2 is 'begin DATA;' (DATA should be in upper case)
3. Lines 3 until the 'end;' of the DATA block are indented
4. Line 3 of DATA block starts with 'dimensions'
5. Line 3 of DATA block contains 'ntax' and 'nchar', each of which is followed by "=" and an integer
6. The 'ntax' integer corresponds to the number of rows in the alignment
7. The 'nchar' integer corresponds to the number of columns in the alignment
8. Line 4 of the DATA block starts 'format'
9. Line 4 contains 'datatype', 'missing', and 'gap'
10. 'datatype' must be either 'nucleotide' or 'protein'
11. If datatype == 'nucleotide', the only character states in the alignment are: A,C,G,T,R,Y,M,K,S,W,H,B,V,D,N,U,?,-
12. If datatype == 'protein', the only character states in the alignment are: A,R,N,D,C,Q,E,G,H,I,L,K,M,F,P,S,T,W,Y,V,?,-
13. 'missing' is '?'
14. 'gap' is '-'
15. The DATA block is correctly defined (i.e. starts with 'begin DATA;' on its own line, ends with 'end;' on its own line)

16. There is a 'SETS' block, correctly defined (see 15)
17. The 'SETS' block contains three comment lines (and only three): '[loci]', '[genomes]', '[outgroups]'
18. The [loci] section contains one or more CHARSET lines, which refer once and only once to every column of the alignment
19. CHARSETs in the [loci] block that end '_1stpos', '_2ndpos' or '3rdpos' come in groups of three, with one and only one of each suffix for a corresponding prefix. E.g. the set of names might be ("COI_1stpos", "COI_2ndpos", "COI_3rdpos". If one or more of these is missing, we have a problem)
20. The [genomes] section contains one or more CHARSETS from this list, with each name appearing at most once:
    mitochondrial_genome
    nuclear_genome
    chloroplast_genome
    dsDNA_genome
    ssDNA_genome
    dsRNA_genome
    ssRNA_genome
21. The [genomes] section contains one or more CHARSET lines, which refer once and only once to every column of the alignment
22. Every charset in the [loci] block is a subset of one and only one of the charsets in the [genomes] block (i.e. a locus can't come from >1 genome, by definition)
23. All charsets parse properly. They can be ranges of sites (e.g. '1-100'), lists of sites (e.g. 1 2 3 4 5), every nth site (e.g. 1-11\3 is the same as 1, 4, 7, 10), or combinations (e.g. 1 7 10-20 100-200\3). They end with a semicolon. Each site appears only once in a given CHARSET.
23. The [outgroups] section may contain nothing, or a single TAXSET
24. If the [outgroups] section has a taxset, it must be called 'outgroups', and start 'TAXSET ougroups = ', and end with a semicolon
25. Names in the [outgroups] section should be separated with single spaces (not commas), and every name should match one of the names in the alignment precisely.

26. There is optionally a 'SAMPLINGDATES' block. 
27. Line one of the block should have 'dimensions ntax =' followed by an integer that matches the number of taxa both in the block itself, and in the 'DATA' block
28. Line two of the block specifies units from a list that currently includes only 'calendaryears' (but which might grow)
29. Each subsequent line specifies a valid taxon name that matches a taxon in the DATA block, followed by a comma, then an integer.


begin SAMPLINGDATES;
    dimensions ntax=50;
    units = calendaryears
