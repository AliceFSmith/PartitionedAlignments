notes: "The authors had a few sites of 28S which were not aligned. These were accounted for the in PF .cfg file by changing the sites assigned to 28s (PF does not have an 'exclude' command or similar). These are the sites that are excluded from the analysis. 28S_unaligned  =  5587-5593 5824-5879 5981-6003 6021-6066 6205-6212 6242-6251 6259-6266 6525-6537 6651-6655 6671-6688 6692-6696 6700-6705 6969-7022;""
