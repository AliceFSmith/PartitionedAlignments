Original_study
Comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of all species of swordtails and platies
(Pisces: Genus Xiphophorus) uncovers a hybrid origin of a swordtail fish,
Xiphophorus monticolus, and demonstrates that the sexually selected sword
originated in the ancestral lineage of the genus, but was lost again secondarily

Xiphophorus (swordtail fish)

Used for tree inference by original authors?
yes. Used to infer the phylogeny of Xiphophorus to determine evolution of sword tail and positioning of various members of Xiphophorous Genus within tree. This dataset contains just the mitochondrial sequences. A separate data set containing just nuclear sequences is available and was also used to infer trees, as well as a combined nuc+mt data set.
