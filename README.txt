Each folder here contains a published alignment of DNA or amino acid sequences. 

Inside each folder is:
    1. A README file which contains the reference to the original paper and/or the dataset
       itself, plus any additional comments on the data (e.g. Taxon, number of spp, number
       of sites, etc).
    2. One or more alignments. Often this will be the original alignment, plus an 
       alignment in phylip format that can be used in PartitionFinder
    3. A partitionfinder.cfg file which describes the dataset for a PartitionFinder run
    4. Optionally, another file: commandlines.txt, which contains a series of example
       commandlines which demonstrate different types of analysis that can be carried out 
       in PartitionFinder using this dataset
       
All of the datasets in this file are publicly available, and links to the original data
are provided in the README file of each folder.
 
If you use ANY of the datasets here, make sure to reference the original study, AND the 
dataset itself if the dataset has its own DOI (e.g. data dryad datasets have their own 
DOI's and should be referenced separately). This is essential to reward and acknowledge
those who spend weeks and months in the field, laboriously chasing frogs/flied/lizards 
etc., then are kind enough to share their data with the world so that people like me (and
you, if you're reading this) can re-use them for other things.

If you have any questions, or would like your dataset to be included here, please contact
me. Contact details are at www.robertlanfear.com/contact
