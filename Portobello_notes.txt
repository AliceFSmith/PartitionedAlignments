Notes on a lunchtime discussion on this database from the Phylogenetics meeting at Portobello in 2015

#Metadata to include:

## Base composition metrics
1. Base composition for overall alignment (include IUPAC bases e.g. N, S, R, Y, W??)
2. Largest GC content (of a taxon)
3. Smallest GC content (of a taxon)
4. Variation in GC content (StDev?)
5. Median GC content

## Diversity metrics
1. Median pairwise JC distance
2. Largest pairwise distance between taxa
3. Smallest pairwise distance among taxa

## Gap statistics
1. Overall proportion of gaps
2. Largest number of gaps in a sequence
3. Smallest number of gaps in a sequence
4. Median gaps per sequence
5. Proportion of columns with at least one gap
6. Something on the distribution of gaps within the alignment??	

## Branch lengths (possibly, but it means inferring a tree)
1. Median branch length
2. Smallest branch length
3. Longest branch length
4. Slope of regression of log(branch depth) vs. log(branch length) - tells you if smaller branches are deeper in the tree or towards the tips

## Time information
1. Dates on all sequences in a .csv file ('NA' for contemporary seqs, be careful with units for e.g. viruses versus aDNA)
2. Rough age of root of the tree from e.g. TimeTree.org

## Label names
1. Might be useful (though a lot of work) to curate label names carefully so you could distinguish members of same species. Esp. for coalescent type datasets. Alternative - restrict database to datasets for which the original authors assumed there was a single bifurcating tree that applied to all the data in the alignment. 

## Simulated data
1. Simulated dataset of the same size, assuming rooted ML tree and ML GTR+I+G parameters, no gaps
2. As for (1), but with original gaps ('-' assumed, not 'N', need to check '?') overlaid on data

## Taxon sampling
1. Viruses
2. Bacteria
3. Archaea
4. Animals
5. Fungi
6. Plants
