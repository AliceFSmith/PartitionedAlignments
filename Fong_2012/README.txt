Notes
This is the SlowGenes dataset, which seems to be the dataset with the smallest amount
of systematic bias. This study uses other methods to make datasets which are better, but
these are not available on Data Dryad. For that reason, this dataset is useful for 
algorithmic approaches to model selection, but perhaps less useful for inferring vertebrate 
phylogeny.

I have also added a second dataset, which is the slowgenes dataset reduced to 16 exemplar 
taxa. This dataset was NOT used in the original study, although they did use other datasets
of the same 16 taxa. Having fewer taxa makes comparing model selection approaches quicker
and more efficient.
