How to change a dataset to nexus format

1. Pull all changes from roblanf/PartitionedAlignments before you start, then for each dataset that needs changing:

2. Import the .phy alignment to Geneious

3. Export it as nexus format (File->Export->Selected documents->Nexus)

4. In the save dialogue, add '.nex' to the file. It will give you a warning which you can ignore and save anyway

5. In the 'Nexus Export' dialogue, there are three tickboxes. Tick the middle one, and untick the top and bottom ones.

6. Click save.

7. Open up the alignment.nex in a text editor (e.g. TextWrangler), and check that it looks OK. It should start with a taxon block, then have the alignment in a characters block. Check that the alignment is the same as the alignment.phy in the same folder.

8. Delete the 'taxon' block, and edit the top of the 'characeters' block to
    (i) change the name to 'DATA'
    (ii) include the ntax dimension from the 'taxon' block
    (iii) if you have a 'dna' or 'rna' datatype, change it to 'nucleotide'

Here's an example:

        begin DATA;
            dimensions ntax=145 nchar=3037;
            format datatype=nucleotide missing=? gap=-;


9. At the bottom, add this new block:

    begin sets;

        [loci]

        [genomes]

        [outgroups]

    end;

9. Inside the 'sets' block, we are aiming for something like this: 

begin SETS;

    [loci]
    CHARSET COI_1stpos = 1-1592\3;
    CHARSET COI_2ndpos = 2-1592\3;
    CHARSET COI_3rdpos = 3-1592\3;
    CHARSET 16S = 1593-3037;

    [genomes]
    CHARSET mitochondrial_genome = 1-3037;

    [outgroups]
    TAXSET outgroups = Afrololigo_mercatoris_FEA Alloteuthis_africana_312327;;

end;

10. You get the CHARSETS from the partitions.txt file. For protein coding genes, we now use the format above, which is e.g. NAME_1stpos. Where "NAME" is the name of the gene.

11. Now check that each protein coding gene really is in the frame you think it should be (and that you have indicated in the nexus file). Do this in geneious by translating it and checking the translation by BLASTing the sequence against GenBank and checking the official translation [THIS BIT IS REALLY IMPORTANT]

12. Add information to the genomes section, to make sure that every single base is covered by one of the following annotations:

    mitochondrial_genome
    nuclear_genome
    chloroplast_genome
    dsDNA_genome
    ssDNA_genome
    dsRNA_genome
    ssRNA_genome

The latter four are reserved for viruses

13. If the data is heterochronous (i.e. sampled from multiple time points) make sure that you include a 'samplingdates' set. See the Duchene dataset(s) for an example.

14. Once you are sure you are done, save your .nex file, and delete the other two files.

15. Load your .nex file into Geneious to check that it works at least there. 

16. Double check for any small errors in the .nex file. This is vital. 

17. Update the YAML file to the required new format.
